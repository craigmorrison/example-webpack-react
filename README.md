An example project for teaching build configuration with React.

## Commands

## Install

```

Tests also run on `git push`.

## Run

To run the site use:

```shell
npm start
```

## Build

To build a deployable version use:

```shell
npm run build
```

## Lint

To check the code style with ESLint run:

```shell
npm run lint
```

ESLint linting also runs on `git commit`.

## Formatting

To check the code style with ESLint run:

```shell
npm run lint
